          <h3>Rule of Thirds</h3>
          <p>City of Pocatello Garbage Collection</p>
          <a href="https://www.pocatello.gov/725/Garbage-Collection"

          <p>
            This is hard to capture on a mobile site. The rule of thirds is
            about the human eye. It has application in art, photography,
            architecture, web design and many others. The human eye tends to
            focus on the page in thirds. Putting the content at the intersection
            of those thirds, horizontally and veritcally, is going to give the
            best view to the viewer.

          <h3>PARC: Proximity</h3>
          <p>Home Depot</p>
          <a href="https://www.homedepot.com/">www.homedepot.com</a><br />
          <img src="images/proximity.jpg" alt="Proximity Image" />
          <p>
            Proximity is the grouping of related elements on a page. As you
            scroll through the home depot's website, the buttons, descriptions,
            photos, etc are all in the same place. You don't have to spend time
            searching for the buttons because it's consisten.

          <h3>PARC: Alignment</h3>
          <p>Serious Eats</p>
          <a href="https://www.seriouseats.com/">www.seriouseats.com</a><br />
          <img src="images/alignment.jpg" alt="Alignment Image" />
          <p>
            Alignment, when used correctly, helps to create a connection between
            related elements on a page. The serious eats website does a good job
            of differentiating unrelated content and making clear what is
            related. Even though an element might not fit entirely on a phone's
            screen, it's easy to tell what belongs to the previous section and
            what belongs to the next section. Even though they're all in the
            same 'column.'
